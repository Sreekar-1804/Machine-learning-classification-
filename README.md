# ü§ñ Machine Learning Classification Project

## üß† Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating **classification models** to predict categorical outcomes based on user and behavioral data.  
It follows a structured machine learning pipeline ‚Äî from **EDA** and **preprocessing** to **model comparison** and **performance evaluation** ‚Äî implemented using Python.

---

## üéØ Objective
To develop a machine learning model that accurately **classifies observations into categories** using various supervised learning techniques.  
The task involves feature understanding, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and optimizing models to improve accuracy.

---

## üß© Dataset
The dataset consists of a combination of **numerical and categorical features**, representing user or product interactions.  
It was provided as part of the **academic coursework** (Modern Application Development ‚Äì Machine Learning).  
The goal variable indicates a **binary or multi-class outcome**, depending on the task configuration.

## üß™ Key Steps in the Project

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and class imbalance  
- Identified missing values and potential outliers  

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Used `SimpleImputer()` for missing value handling  
- Applied One-Hot Encoding and Ordinal Encoding for categorical features  
- Performed scaling for numerical variables where required  

### 3. **Model Building**
Trained and compared multiple classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**  
- Visualized **Confusion Matrices** and **ROC Curves**  
- Selected the best model based on validation performance  

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Optimized parameters using `RandomizedSearchCV`  
- Improved model generalization while preventing overfitting
